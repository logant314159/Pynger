# Pynger
Pynger is a cross-platform rewrite of Arpy, an old and much uglier program of mine.

Pynger will scan a list of local IPs (ARP & Ping) and display their connection statuses based off of the response.
It has a dynamically-sizing grid layout and the capability to send a push notification to the machine you're on when an IP registers as connected.
